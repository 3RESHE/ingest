# Core Concepts

Ingest is built on several fundamental concepts that make it powerful 
and flexible.

## Unopinionated Design

Ingest doesn't force you into specific patterns or structures. 
You're free to:
- Organize your code as you see fit
- Choose your preferred tools and libraries
- Implement your own architectural patterns

## Event-Driven Architecture

The framework is built around an event-driven model:
- Events are the primary mechanism for communication
- Handlers respond to specific events
- Asynchronous processing is first-class

## Pluggable System

Extend functionality through plugins:
- Add new features without modifying core code
- Share reusable components
- Create custom middleware

## Serverless First

Designed with serverless deployment in mind:
- Stateless by default
- Quick cold starts
- Efficient resource usage

## File-Based Routing

Organize your routes using the filesystem:
- Intuitive directory structure
- Automatic route generation
- Clean separation of concerns

## Type Safety

Built with TypeScript for better development experience:
- Full type definitions
- Compile-time checks
- Better IDE support

For practical examples of these concepts, 
see the [Examples](./examples.md) section.
